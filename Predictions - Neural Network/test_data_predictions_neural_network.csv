0,tt0087803,1984,"Based on George Orwell's novel. In a totalitarian future society, Winston Smith, whose work is re-writing history, tries to rebel. He meets a kindred spirit named Julia and they fall into a love affair. Sir Richard Burton's final film.Longing for freedom, the lowly bureaucrat of the Ministry of Truth, Winston Smith, summons up the courage to write down his unspoken desires in his little secret diary. Serving silently at the pleasure of the grim, autocratic hyper-state of Oceania, Smith knows that the English Socialist Party's supreme leader, the omnipotent Big Brother, watches his every move, condemning the already terrified people into a life of slavery. Under those dire circumstances--as the totalitarian government's suffocating stranglehold tightens more and more--Julia, another equally seditious party member, crosses paths with Winston, and a dangerous clandestine affair begins. Now, there's no turning back, and, sooner or later, the illicit couple will have to pay for its hideous crimes against the dictatorial state. What makes a good citizen? —Nick Riganas","['Drama', 'Sci-Fi']","{'Crime': 10.0, 'Comedy': 9.99233959042741, 'Drama': 9.6956188418653, 'Documentary': 0.0036200104224044867, 'Thriller': 0.0006380582842504156, 'Family': 0.00037874874249212967, 'Biography': 0.00032828064078363104, 'Action': 5.758696378939954e-06, 'Mystery': 5.023984038224881e-06, 'Short': 7.426509992949147e-07, 'Sci-Fi': 4.855713597908767e-07, 'Film-Noir': 6.958987940524391e-08, 'Western': 5.481177260771889e-08, 'Adult': 1.2666613466178219e-08, 'None': 5.770884720321583e-09, 'Sport': 2.190318250994392e-09, 'Fantasy': 1.3781109329167173e-09, 'Horror': 4.739976748852435e-10, 'Adventure': 2.815787641378097e-10, 'News': 8.963322108200049e-12, 'Musical': 3.0669410991333093e-13, 'Music': 2.1382277687069953e-13, 'History': 3.563241876835778e-14, 'War': 1.743020583854723e-17, 'Animation': 0.0}"

For the men in Barracks 4, all sergeants, have to deal with a grave problem - there seems to be a security leak. The Germans always seem to be forewarned about escapes and in the most recent attempt the two men, Manfredi and Johnson, walked straight into a trap and were killed. For some in Barracks 4, especially the loud-mouthed Duke, the leaker is obvious: J.J. Sefton, a wheeler-dealer who doesn't hesitate to trade with the guards and who has acquired goods and privileges that no other prisoner seems to have. Sefton denies giving the Germans any information and makes it quite clear that he has no intention of ever trying to escape. He plans to ride out the war in what little comfort he can arrange, but it doesn't extend to spying for the Germans. As tensions mount and mob mentality takes root, it becomes obvious Sefton will have to find the real German agent in their midst, which he finally does. —garykmcd","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'War']","{'Thriller': 10.0, 'War': 5.13578227590023, 'Horror': 0.18345589940815193, 'History': 0.1550241968166442, 'Music': 0.004584669830707522, 'Western': 0.0010682935684771994, 'Crime': 0.00018214159673613056, 'Adventure': 0.00010827350466658027, 'Action': 5.498731460652939e-05, 'Documentary': 1.4623740390085496e-05, 'Drama': 2.270123311388204e-06, 'Fantasy': 7.351943106600458e-07, 'Short': 2.5408023948222504e-07, 'Comedy': 1.433825323143569e-07, 'None': 1.4084761831806578e-07, 'Film-Noir': 1.091449123988963e-09, 'Mystery': 2.0069182152885763e-10, 'Family': 1.5924899528651726e-11, 'Adult': 1.8343489065480537e-12, 'Musical': 7.39591061932003e-14, 'Sci-Fi': 6.4126537754126136e-15, 'News': 5.803271795245546e-15, 'Biography': 1.3501666760980066e-15, 'Sport': 2.677519153739585e-17, 'Animation': 0.0}"
