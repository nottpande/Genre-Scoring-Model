The more involved Garrett gets in the case, the more attracted he is to Cross, but as they get closer, so does the killer. Written By:\\n Swanson Fan\\n\\nAfter a suspension of six months for disrespect to the chain of command in the police force, detective Max Garrett is assigned to work with Lieutenant Eddie Fulton in a murder case in another precinct. Both have the mission of protecting the photographer Laura Cross from the prime suspect of the crime, the super Gus Boyle. Max is having troubles in his marriage with his wife Diana, who misses him, and the proximity with the gorgeous and seductive Laura is deeply affecting him.

It wasn't an easy road...from bootstrapping to bearing fruit, we weave together the stories of these inspiring creators in a full length documentary to inspire other women who may be considering starting their own businesses. The production is set in Beautiful Central Florida, where an amazing synergy is taking place like never before. We follow various local groups that have popped up to support and nurture the female entrepreneur and explore the love economy in action with the legendary feminist and futurist, Hazel Henderson.

On a live broadcast, she castigates her boyfriend Dale (who's the show's anchorman) for sleeping with his co-anchor; then she quits. She'd been living with Dale, who explains himself by saying she's cold, so she moves in temporarily with her younger brother Walt. His neighbor Byron, a computer programmer, is always in Walt's flat working. While Sylvia looks for a job, Byron offers himself as a no-strings-attached rebound-sex partner, with the condition that she not tell Walt. How will she respond, and what about finding work, living with her brother, sorting things out with Dale, and being cold?

It's really about her.\\n\\nThat's kind of my point, it doesn't say\\nanything about how he feels about her.\\n\\nIt's nothing personal.\\n\\nNo, this is important.\\n\\nThis is artistic perfection.\\n\\nIt's a catchy tune.\\n\\n(Laughs)\\n\\nOkay, okay.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nHow about this.\\n\\nWhy does it matter?\\n\\nIf he loves her, why does it matter?\\n\\nI don't know, maybe because\\nshe's moving to another state for him?\\n\\nBecause she loves him.\\n\\nYeah, she loves him.\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nNo, you can't do that.\\n\\nIt might be one sided is all I'm saying.\\n\\nMaybe he's letter her come back with\\nhim in an effort to hold on to his dreams,\\n\\nlike a keepsake.\\n\\nMaybe that's what she is\\nto him, a kind of comfort.\\n\\nNo, you're projecting, there's\\nnothing about that in the song.\\n\\nYou said, \\\"greatest love song ever\\\"\\n\\nexcept there's nothing about\\nhow he feels towards her.\\n\\nCase closed.\\n\\n(Laughs)\\n\\nDo you think she loves him?\\n\\nI'd say... she thinks she does, but\\nmaybe it's not shared, we just don't know.\\n\\nThe look, how can someone ever truly give\\nlove to someone else if they're waiting\\n\\nfor it to be returned in equal measure?\\n\\nThat's conditional love.\\n\\nAll I'm saying is if it isn't\\nmutual it isn't going to last\\n\\nand when I think of love I\\nthink of something lasting.\\n\\nYou ever been in love?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nBut it didn't last.\\n\\nNope.\\n\\nSo was it love?\\n\\nNot the kind I wanted it to be.\\n\\nAnd you?\\n\\nYeah, I've been in love.\\n\\nMmmhmm, how many times?\\n\\nThree and a half.\\n\\nMe too.\\n\\nMaybe the half we dated at the same time.\\n\\nOh my god.\\n\\nWas he six foot tall?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nGood looking, smart, funny?\\n\\nYes, yes and yes.\\n\\nWith a Cheshire cat tattoo near his vagina?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nReally?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSurprised that didn't last.\\n\\nOh, how judgy are you?\\n\\nMeow.\\n\\nLook it's not like relationships\\ncome with an expiration date.\\n\\nYou know, you just...\\n\\nCome here.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nI want to try something.\\n\\nI bet.\\n\\nTurn around.\\n\\nIt's not weird, turn around.\\n\\nYou've got a great ass.\\n\\nBut we can talk about that later.\\n\\nOr not.\\n\\nHands by your side.\\n\\nI'm not going to look at your ass.\\n\\nMuch.\\n\\nI'm kidding, turn around,\\ncome on, hands by your side.\\n\\nClose your eyes.\\n\\nFall back.\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nClose your eyes and fall back.\\n\\nI don't think this is a good...\\n\\nIt's gonna be great!\\n\\nFall back.\\n\\nI got you.\\n\\nI don't want to do this.\\n\\nOh come on, you don't trust me?\\n\\nNo, it's not that I'm\\nuncomfortable falling.\\n\\nThat's alright.\\n\\n(Background music)\\n\\nIt's not that I don't trust you.\\n\\nI was being silly.\\n\\nYou can trust someone without\\nproving you'd fall out of a window.\\n\\nI was just trying to\\nlook at your ass anyway.\\n\\nWhat color was it?\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nThe Cheshire cat.\\n\\nAh.\\n\\nI'm not going to answer that.\\n\\nOn the grounds that I wish to move past\\ndiscussing ex-girlfriends' vaginal art.\\n\\n(Camera click)\\n\\nIt was green wasn't it?\\n\\nYou wish.\\n\\n(Laughs)\\n\\n(Camera click)\\n\\n(Background music)\\n\\n(Music)\\n\\nThis remind you of anything?\\n\\nUm...\\n\\nJules and Jim.\\n\\nNo way.\\n\\nI can't believe you know this movie.\\n\\nI used to dress like Jeanne Moreau.\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nYou know that hat she wore?\\n\\nUh huh.\\n\\nYeah, I wasn't very popular.\\n\\nOh man.\\n\\nI would totally have been\\nfriends with you and your ugly hat.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nYou're welcome.\\n\\nMan I love this movie.\\n\\nYeah, me too.\\n\\nParlez-vous fran\\u00e7ais?\\n\\nNot at all.\\n\\nYou don't know the lyrics?\\n\\nWell...\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nI don't either.\\n\\nYou're screwing with me.\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\nMake 'em up.\\n\\nHuh?\\n\\nMake up the lyrics.\\n\\nSeriously.\\n\\nSure.\\n\\nJust try imagining them.\\n\\nOr something.\\n\\nHmm.\\n\\nI'd say she's singing about a\\nhappy moment from her past.\\n\\nYou must be really good with numbers.\\n\\nWhat was that?\\n\\nShe's singing about a happy moment\\nfrom... you can do better than that.\\n\\nOh fine.\\n\\nI am very good with numbers.\\n\\nI'm sure.\\n\\nGet in the zone.\\n\\nShhh.

mean?\\n\\nCome on, no.\\n\\nWell he lives in Astoria.\\n\\nWe think he lives in Astoria.\\n\\nHe definitely lives in\\nAstoria, or at least visits.\\n\\nActually, nobody visits Queens\\nso I'm sure he lives there.\\n\\nWhy do you say that?\\n\\nBecause Manhattanites and\\nBrooklynites are snobs like that.\\n\\nNo, why do you think he lives there?\\n\\nOh, he mentions Kelly's.\\n\\nYou know Kelly?\\n\\nIt's a bar, not a guy.\\n\\nYeah my friends and I\\nused to go there a lot.\\n\\nHey...\\n\\nI need to go there.\\n\\nWell lets grab brunch first huh?\\n\\nI'm starving.\\n\\n(Diner

but\\nthat had nothing to do with the tiff\\n\\nshe had started with Jared.\\nShe was feeling a sort of guilt over\\n\\npermitting Jared to join in on\\nher search for the journal's author.\\n\\n(Sports broadcast on TV)\\n\\nWhat can I do ya for?\\n\\nHi, I'm looking for...\\n\\nTwo IPA's.\\n\\nPlease\\n\\nWe used to do karaoke here every Saturday.\\n\\nGuessing you're not much

come in a lot.\\n\\nCome back on Friday, when\\nLindsay's behind the bar.\\n\\nHey.\\n\\nPopcorn or candy?\\n\\nPopcorn's healthier.\\n\\nYeah but...\\n\\nWhere's Jared?\\n\\nHe's not coming.\\n\\nThat sucks, I wanted to\\nthank him for the playlist.\\n\\nI'll let him know.\\n\\nHow much do you think the\\nfruit counts in Raisinettes?\\n\\nIf it was fruit they'd be called\\nchocolate covered raisins.\\n\\nHi.\\n\\nSo how's it going?\\n\\nI have no idea what to where, it's totally\\nweird because I know so much about him and\\n\\nyet he knows nothing about me so it's\\nkind of like who do I want to be, ya know?\\n\\nI'm thinking of wearing the black\\ndress, ya know the one I wore...\\n\\nI was talking about Jared.\\n\\nHow are things going with Jared?\\n\\nGood.\\n\\nGood?\\n\\nYeah they're going really well.\\n\\nAnd that's why you're in\\na tizzy over what to wear?\\n\\nI hope you find this guy because\\nyou're being an idiot right now.\\n\\nOkay...\\n\\nWell I'm sorry but you are.\\n\\nJared is a great guy and you're\\npining over an imaginary friend.\\n\\nI'm not pining, I just find this\\nwhole mystery thing exciting.\\n\\nIt's always exciting, April.\\n\\nIf it's not a journal it's the guy buying\\n\\nyour favorite breakfast\\nbar or the guy sitting\\n\\nacross from you reading the Village Voice.\\n\\nAt a certain point you\\nneed to say \\\"close enough.\\\"\\n\\nI don't want you to make a mistake.\\n\\nLike when you say \\\"close\\nenough\\\" what does that mean?\\n\\nWhat parts are close enough?\\n\\nWhere are we supposed to trim?\\n\\nWhat parts?\\n\\nI don't know, April.\\n\\nI don't want \\\"close enough,\\\" you can\\nsay it's immature or idealistic or naive...\\n\\nOver speaker: We're now seating for the\\n\\nseven-thirty showing of\\nThe Philadelphia Story.\\n\\nSo what are you going to do about Jared?\\n\\nIt's two completely different things.\\n\\nExcept it's not.\\n\\nLook, I like Jared, I enjoy spending time\\nwith him, we're learning about each other.\\n\\nIt's just, I'm trying not to think so much.\\n\\nYou're the one always\\ntelling me not to think so much.\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\nIf this journal guy ends up\\nbeing some sort of soulmate\\n\\nI'm going to have to\\nrethink the entire universe.\\n\\n(Door opens)\\n\\n(Door closes)\\n\\nLet me see it.\\n\\nI wouldn't feel comfortable with that.\\n\\nDid you read it?\\n\\nI looked for his contact information.\\n\\nRight.\\n\\nAm I in it?\\n\\nI don't think so, I... no.\\n\\nYeah well he's a douche.\\n\\nHe's a liar so don't believe\\nanything that he says.\\n\\nHe plays innocent but he's not.\\n\\nDo you know where I can find him?\\n\\nYeah, um, he lives around\\nthe corner on forty-second.\\n\\nIt's...\\n\\nI don't know the exact address but it's\\nthe one with the Bob Marley on the door.\\n\\nOh, what is his name?\\n\\nDave Moore.\\n\\nDouchebag Dave.\\n\\nWhat are you doing?\\n\\nThat's a good question.\\n\\nI'm glad I didn't get the limo.\\n\\nWhat time is it?\\n\\nDoesn't matter.\\n\\nDid you find him?\\n\\nYes, no.\\n\\nWas it all fireworks and lightening bolts?\\n\\nI...\\n\\nI haven't...\\n\\nWhat are you doing?\\n\\nReturning the journal.\\n\\nWhen you were supposed to be getting ready\\n\\nfor the gala, which I\\ncan't help but notice\\n\\nyou're dressed rather\\nnicely for having forgotten.\\n\\nJared, I'm ready, lets go.\\n\\nI'm not ready.\\n\\nApril I've fallen for you.\\n\\nSee I'm scared too.\\n\\nBecause what that really means is\\nthat I think I'm falling in love with you.\\n\\nWhich means I am in love with you.\\n\\nBut if you don't feel the same way...\\n\\nI do.\\n\\nI keep waiting.\\n\\nFor you to let go, to trust me.\\n\\nNow I'm starting to feel\\nlike that's not the problem.\\n\\nBurn it.\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nBurn it.\\n\\nIt's not mine, that's not fair.\\n\\nRemember when we were talking about love\\n\\nand you said it had to be\\nmutual or it was pointless?\\n\\nI think you were right.\\n\\nJared please.\\n\\nGood luck.\\n\\n(Car door closes)\\n\\n(Music)\\n\\nNarrator: And just like that, the urgency\\n\\nassociated with the\\njournal had disappeared.\\n\\nIn a strange way the pain\\nwas a relief, an outing of sorts.\\n\\nBut as April reflected on the many\\nmistakes she had made along the way\\n\\nthere was one question she couldn't shake.\\n\\nWhy had she been the\\none to find the journal?\\n\\n(Music)\\n\\n(Knock on door)\\n\\n(Footsteps)\\n\\nYeah?\\n\\nDave?\\n\\n(Door closes)\\n\\nNice place.\\n\\nYou knew Dave?\\n\\nI found his journal.\\n\\nDave kept a journal?\\n\\nI don't know.\\n\\nLet's see it.\\n\\n(Snaps fingers)\\n\\nI prefer to give it to Dave,\\njust because it's personal.\\n\\nIs he here?\\n\\nHe's dead.\\n\\nWhat do you mean?\\n\\nHe died, he's dead, gone, poof, over.\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\nHe killed himself.\\n\\nAnd you care because?\\n\\nI'm sorry.\\n\\nHere.\\n\\nWait.\\n\\n(Searching through clutter)\\n\\nThis is his mom's place.\\n\\nShe won't see me.\\n\\n(Door closes)\\n\\n(Music)\\n\\nMay I help you?\\n\\nAre you Dave's mother?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nI have something I think you'd like to see.\\n\\nPlease come in.\\n\\nHe never lost the pudge, I'm afraid.\\n\\nThis is a more recent one.\\n\\nI had no idea he kept a journal.\\n\\nEven in the afterlife he\\ncontinues to surprise me.\\n\\nHe had an amazing\\nway of expressing himself.\\n\\nI feel like we would have been friends.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nYou're very kind to have\\nmade the effort to return it.\\n\\nCan I... ask you... a question?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nMay I ask if you know...\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nIt's hard to believe any one thing\\ncould lead to something like this.\\n\\nWhen he was a boy, David loved sports.\\n\\nHe'd play for hours with\\nthe neighborhood kids.\\n\\nAnd I remember him coming\\nhome one day after school,\\n\\nI think it was junior high,\\nyes, and he was really upset.\\n\\nHe'd been cut from the\\nschool basketball team.\\n\\nI tried talking to him, telling\\nhim there was always next year.\\n\\nHe was convinced it was over.\\n\\nHis basketball career\\nhad ended in sixth grade.\\n\\nDavid took everything so hard.\\n\\nI'm sure it was many things but he...\\n\\nHe just didn't like himself.\\n\\nWhich has to be the toughest\\nthing for a parent to understand.\\n\\nAs a mother you remember him as this big.\\n\\nWide-eyed and full of promise.\\n\\nYou don't understand how they can't\\nlove themselves when you love them\\n\\nso much it's painful. It's\\nnot even love anymore.\\n\\nIt's life, it's meaning.\\n\\nYou question everything, you\\nblame yourself for not being able\\n\\nto keep the happiness they had as\\na child bottled up inside them forever.\\n\\nHow did it get out?\\n\\nWhere did it go?\\n\\nI just never saw what there wasn't to like?\\n\\nI'm so sorry.\\n\\n(Doorbell)\\n\\nOh Lord, look at me.\\n\\nOh hello Father.\\n\\nSomething sweet.\\n\\nOh look at that.\\n\\nHow kind of you.\\n\\nCome in, please.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\n(Door closes)\\n\\nFather Randy, this is April.\\n\\nShe was returning something of David's.\\n\\nI'm just going to put this in the kitchen.\\n\\nHave a seat, please.\\n\\nWe're you at the memorial?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nNo, I... didn't really know him.\\n\\nOh.\\n\\nFather Randy gave the most\\namazing sermon at David's funeral.\\n\\nDivinely inspired.\\n\\nThank you, Donna, thank you.\\n\\nApril here found David's journal on the\\nsubway and tracked us down to return it.\\n\\nIsn't that just the kindest thing?\\n\\nIt is, yes.\\n\\nI can't bring myself to open it.\\n\\nApparently he wrote quite well.\\n\\nHe had a gift.\\n\\nI should be going.\\n\\nOh I have a plate of cookies for ya.\\n\\nThat's not...\\n\\nPeople have dropped off a\\ndecade's worth of sweets, I swear.\\n\\nThat must have been quite\\na task trying to track us down.\\n\\nIt's nothing really.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nNo, thank you.\\n\\nVery nice to meet you.\\n\\n(Music)\\n\\n(Knock on door)\\n\\n(Knock on door)\\n\\n(Groaning)\\n\\n(Unlocking door)\\n\\n(Opens door)\\n\\nDid I catch you at a bad time?\\n\\nNo, I was...\\n\\nI hope you don't mind, I got\\nyour information from Donna.\\n\\nDonna Moore.\\n\\nI was hoping to speak to you\\nabout the journal, if you don't mind.\\n\\nUgh, that journal.\\n\\n(Bangs head on door)\\n\\nWell I can also, I can\\ncome back another time.\\n\\nNo, I was...\\n\\nUh how about if I wait for you over here.\\n\\nI'll be right out.\\n\\n(Door closes)\\n\\n(Door closes)\\n\\nWhat can I help you with?\\n\\nWell if you don't mind\\nI was hoping to hear\\n\\nabout how you went\\nabout returning the journal.\\n\\nI'd say tragically.\\n\\nIs everything okay?\\n\\nNo, I'm sorry, it was a\\nlot to take in yesterday.\\n\\nOh I'm sure.\\n\\nWhen I first found the journal...\\n\\nNarrator: April retold the\\nentire journey of the journal.\\n\\nFrom the subway to the\\nCraigslist guy to the fight with Jared\\n\\nto the failed drop off\\nattempt at Ms. Moore's home.\\n\\nOnce April had reached the end of her\\ntale she felt lighter but no less confused.\\n\\nOh ye of little faith.\\n\\nThat is quite a story.\\n\\nThe odds, the odds must have been...\\n\\nDoesn't matter, does it?\\n\\nPardon?\\n\\nIt's too late, I tried\\nto return the journal\\n\\nas quickly as I could, I mean I did but\\n\\nI slowed down after I met Jared and...\\n\\nApril I hope you're not feeling\\nguilty over David's death.\\n\\nIf you thought returning the journal\\nwould somehow thwart his suicide,\\n\\nI don't think so.\\n\\nIt's just...\\n\\nI wanted him to know that\\nhe wasn't alone in how he felt.\\n\\nMaybe it would have...\\n\\nIt wouldn't have.\\n\\nHow do you know?\\n\\nDavid was deeply troubled.\\n\\nAnd uh also,\\n\\nbecause it's my journal.\\n\\nThe odds must have been in the billions.\\n\\nDid you just say...?\\n\\nYeah, I wrote it.\\n\\nIt's mine.\\n\\n(Laughing)\\n\\nBrilliant.\\n\\nWait...\\n\\nThat's what I'm saying, the odds.\\n\\nIt appears that you and I\\nwere on the same mission.\\n\\nYou see I wrote the journal while I was in\\n\\nmy twenties, but I\\nwanted David to know that\\n\\nhere was someone who felt lost, isolated,\\n\\nscared, and eventually\\nsomehow made it through.\\n\\nAnd like you, I felt a\\nmeasure of guilt over his death.\\n\\nAs if my intention somehow\\nhad the opposite affect.\\n\\n(Sigh)\\n\\nI started looking for reasons.\\n\\nYou'd think I'd know by now that you can't\\n\\nforce a reason upon a\\ngreater unknown plan.\\n\\nIt made me feel less alone.\\n\\nPardon?\\n\\nThe journal made me feel less alone.\\n\\nWell thank you for sharing your story.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\nI should go now.\\n\\nThere uh... there was a wise man who once\\nsaid, \\\"you can't always get what you want,\\n\\nbut if you try sometime you\\njust might get what you need.\\\"\\n\\nThe odds, billions.\\n\\n(Door closes)\\n\\n(Children playing)\\n\\nNarrator: April thought back\\nto choices she had made,\\n\\nmostly choices she had not made.\\n\\nChoices like not searching for a new job\\n\\nbecause she was sure\\nthe hours would be worse,\\n\\nor not joining friends\\non a ski trip to Vermont\\n\\nfor she was sure to\\nembarrass herself on the slopes.\\n\\nIt occurred to her that\\nshe was so intensely\\n\\nfocused on the outcome of her choices that\\n\\nshe was missing the moments in-between.\\n\\nBut it's the moments that\\ngive meaning to the outcome.\\n\\nIt's the moments that\\nprovide the allegiance,\\n\\nthe excitement,\\n\\nthe sorrow,\\n\\nthe faith,\\n\\nthe love,\\n\\nof life.\\n\\nWith moments...\\n\\nMr. X: nothing's really ever lost.\\n\\nSo have you talked to him?\\n\\nHe's not taking my calls.\\n\\nDon't blame him.\\n\\nLost out to a gay, dead man.\\n\\nA priest, actually.\\n\\nOh god...\\n\\nThank you for supporting\\nme, no, really, I appreciate it.\\n\\nAlmost got you a cat.\\n\\nI am not ready for a cat.\\n\\nWe need a game plan.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nGot it.\\n\\nText him an n-a-k-e-d photo of\\nyourself, with your face showing.\\n\\nIt says so much.\\n\\nYes, yes it does.\\n\\n(Laughter)\\n\\n(Music)\\n\\nCall you tonight.\\n\\nOkay, hey, with your face!\\n\\nUh huh.\\n\\nCarly?\\n\\nHun, tie your shoe.\\n\\n(Music)\\n\\n(Knock on door)\\n\\n(Footsteps)\\n\\n(Unlocking door)\\n\\n(Door opens)\\n\\nApril.\\n\\n(Crash)\\n\\nOw.\\n\\nAre you okay?\\n\\nOw!\\n\\nOhhh.\\n\\n(Chuckle)\\n\\nI have a concussion.\\n\\nHow many fingers am I holding up?\\n\\nMmm two?\\n\\nYeah, you're okay.\\n\\nNo, I have a concussion.\\n\\nWhat are you doing here, April?\\n\\nI'm trying...\\n\\nTo prove you're crazy?\\n\\nDid it work?\\n\\nMission accomplished.\\n\\nAnd I'm sorry I...\\n\\nI want to be with you.\\n\\nI've been looking for you for so long, long\\nbefore I found this journal and I maybe,\\n\\nI guess I got scared.\\n\\nI understand.\\n\\nI've been fooling myself\\ninto believing that I...\\n\\nOw.\\n\\nWhat?\\n\\nI get it.\\n\\nYou do?\\n\\n(Sigh)\\n\\nFear.\\n\\nIs one of the signs, ya know?\\n\\nHow's your head?\\n\\n(Groan)\\n\\n(Laugh)\\n\\nI'm still concussed.\\n\\nYeah?\\n\\nSee if this helps.\\n\\nMmm...\\n\\nNuh uh.\\n\\nNo?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nNothing?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nAgain.\\n\\nAgain?\\n\\nUh huh.\\n\\nOkay.\\n\\nBetter?\\n\\nCome on.\\n\\nWhy don't you let doctor Jared\\ngive you a thorough examination.\\n\\nThat is so creepy.\\n\\nNarrator: For the briefest of moments\\n\\nApril wondered if she and Jared would\\nspend the rest of their lives together.\\n\\nAnd then,\\n\\njust as quickly,\\n\\n(Door closes)\\n\\nShe wondered what\\nthey'd be having for dinner.\",\n          \"(dramatic orchestral music)\\n\\n(bell rings)\\n\\n- Captain Carter?\\n\\nThe general's expecting you, sir.\\n\\nThis way, sir.\\n\\n- Glory be.\\n\\nYou a solider, boy?\\n\\nI mean, you in the army?\\n\\n- Yes, sir.\\n\\n- What's this?\\n\\n- Well, my uniform, sir.\\n\\n- Your uniform?\\n\\n- Yes, sir.\\n\\nYou see, I'm detailed to\\ngeneral armaments, sir.\\n\\n- Glory be.\\n\\n- I'm glad you could come, Carter.\\n\\n- I never say no to a general.\\n\\n- Kings and counts used\\nto dine on this terrace.\\n\\n- You should feel right at home.\\n\\n- Captain, I have a job for you.\\n\\n- I appreciate the\\nhospitality, General, but, uh,\\n\\nI'll walk to Berlin before\\nI mix drinks for you.\\n\\n- Captain, we have people\\nto do that in the army.\\n\\nNo, I want you for something else.\\n\\nI want you to save a dam.\\n\\nThere's a dam on the\\nAufgein Lake right here.\\n\\nOur main force is more\\nthan 50 miles away here.\\n\\nIf the Jerries know we're\\ncoming, they'll blow it up\\n\\nand if they do, they'll stall our advance\\n\\nfor at least two days\\nand flood the valley.\\n\\nWhat we want to do

can circle on\\naround down here to the south.\\n\\n- It's gonna be tough, sheriff.\\n\\nThey're callin' for five or\\nmore inches of snow tonight.\\n\\n- Yeah, I heard the forecast.\\n\\nWell, maybe

don't think so.\\n\\nNumber one, it's a disease\\nthat afflicts children only,\\n\\nas far as we know.\\n\\nNumber two, Ed's body has\\ndeteriorated beyond old age,\\n\\nalmost to the point of\\nbeing a decayed corpse.\\n\\nThe blood, the internal organs, dehydrated.\\n\\n- But it could be this\\ndisease you're talking about?\\n\\n- I wish I could say yes, Jack,\\n\\nthat would make things so much

now.\\n\\nNow, what do you have on Rex Walker?\\n\\n- Jack, I don't know what's\\ngoing on around here.\\n\\nBesides being mangled,\\nRex's body was loaded\\n\\nwith some sort of very lethal poison.\\n\\nAs far a Steven and I could ascertain,\\n\\nthe poison entered the body\\nthrough the flesh wounds.\\n\\n- Which means it couldn't\\nhave been a bear or a bobcat\\n\\nthat killed Rex.\\n\\nSo, where does that leave us?\\n\\n- Oh, hello Ruth.\\n\\nI just came from your place.\\n\\nSteven told me what happened to ed Miller.\\n\\nLet me ask you, do you\\nhave any other conclusions?\\n\\n- There are no other\\nconclusions at this point, Burt.\\n\\nLook, I gotta get back to the office.\\n\\nJack, if anything else\\nturns up, I'll let you know.\\n\\n- [Jack] Okay,

sure, I'm somewhat familiar with that.\\n\\n- Anyway, two nights ago, I\\nobserved a small meteorite\\n\\nthat did enter the atmosphere.\\n\\nI tracked it down as much as possible,\\n\\nand it seemingly hit the earth.\\n\\nWell, by my estimation,\\n\\nit hit somewhere on the\\nnorth side of your town.\\n\\n- A meteor?\\n\\n- Yes, that's why I came here.\\n\\nI'm somewhat of an

hit, that is, if it really did hit,\\n\\naround four in the morning.\\n\\nAnd like I said, it was\\nvery small to begin with.\\n\\nNo, I'd say that it hit\\n\\naround eight to 10 miles out in the hills,\\n\\nso it's not likely\\n\\nthat anybody would've\\nseen it in the first place.\\n\\n- Sounds a little wild,\\na meteor landing here.\\n\\n- Maybe landing.\\n\\nNow, that's why I looked you up.\\n\\nI just wanted to let you know\\n\\nthat I'll be poking around these hills\\n\\nfor a couple of days if\\nthat's all right with you.\\n\\n- Of course it's all right with me,\\n\\nbut those

there\\n\\nabout three or four miles.\\n\\n- And we've got to go\\nby foot from here, huh?\\n\\n- Right, there's no roads back there.\\n\\nIt's pretty rough terrain,\\nmostly hills and gullies.\\n\\n(Suspenseful electronic music)\\n\\nWhat in god's name is that?\\n\\n- Well, it looks like my meteor\\n\\nis a space craft of some kind.\\n\\nCome on, mayor, let's take a closer look.\\n\\n- Mr. Zachary, I have to\\nadmit, that's one hell of a sight.\\n\\n- Yes, it is.\\n\\nDo you have any idea what\\nthis means, mayor wicker?\\n\\n- No, and I'm not sure I wanna know.\\n\\n- Wait a minute.\\n\\n(Electronic warbling)\\n\\nThat noise.\\n\\n- What noise?\\n\\nZachary, Zachary.\\n\\nWhere are you going?\\n\\nWhat's wrong?\\n\\nWhere the hell do you think you're going?\\n\\n- Quiet.\\n\\n- God, what's that?\\n\\n- Mayor, please.\\n\\nIt's trying to communicate with me.\\n\\n(Electronic warbling)\\n\\n- Are you all right?\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\nWhat was all that about?\\n\\nThe blue light?\\n\\n- Look, I'll explain later.\\n\\nWe've gotta get outta here fast.\\n\\nThat thing is going to explode!\\n\\n(Discordant electronic music)\\n\\n(Explosion booms)\\n\\n- Space ships?\\n\\nCreatures?\\n\\nWhat're you trying to feed us here?\\n\\n- Jack, would you just listen?\\n\\n- So when I knelt over the creature,\\n\\nmy mind went momentarily blank,\\n\\nand then I was aware\\nof a bright blue light.\\n\\nThen, thoughts began to enter my mind.\\n\\nIt wasn't really as though\\nsomeone was talking to me,\\n\\nbut I knew that these thoughts were there.\\n\\nThe creature communicating with me\\n\\nwas apparently transporting\\nzoological specimens\\n\\nback to his home planet.\\n\\nNow I know that he had three creatures\\n\\nthat were captured in\\nvarious parts of the galaxy,\\n\\nbut something went\\nwrong with his space craft,\\n\\nand he was forced down to earth.\\n\\nWhen the ship crashed, the\\nalien was mortally wounded,\\n\\nand the electronic screens\\nholding the specimens\\n\\nwere deactivated, and\\nthe specimens were freed.\\n\\n(Suspenseful electronic music)\\n\\nThose creature specimens\\n\\nhave obviously been\\nkilling your townspeople.\\n\\nNow, I know that the\\ncreatures are air breathers,\\n\\nor at least two of them are,\\n\\nand those two are basically\\nnon-thinking animal forms.\\n\\nThey're probably on the\\noffensive in a strange environment\\n\\nstriking anything that moves.\\n\\nBut the alien communicated\\nthat the third specimen\\n\\nis a clever-thinking\\ncreature and the killer.\\n\\nThe only thing I know\\nabout that third creature\\n\\nis that it's hard to\\ndetect in bright light.\\n\\nI assume it must be some\\nsort of an energy being.\\n\\nAnd that's it.\\n\\nThat's all I know.\\n\\nThe alien died, I guess,\\nand the thoughts stopped\\n\\nright after it communicated\\n\\nthat the spaceship was about to explode.\\n\\n- You really expect us to believe all that?\\n\\n- Jack, believe him.\\n\\nI was there, it happened.\\n\\nI saw it!\\n\\nWell, Mr. Zachary, what\\ndo you suggest we do?\\n\\nI guess we should call in the\\narmy on something like this.\\n\\n- Not necessarily, mayor.\\n\\nI have a lot of equipment with me.\\n\\nAnd since this sort\\nof thing is in my field,\\n\\nI think I can stop the creatures.\\n\\n- With what?\\n\\nI thought bullets didn't have any effect\\n\\non these creatures.\\n\\n- Conventional weapons\\nmay not work, Ms. Martin.\\n\\nBut like I said, I do have\\nsome special equipment.\\n\\nWell, it's up to you, mayor.\\n\\nIf you'd like me to try, I'm\\nwilling to start right away.\\n\\n- Burt, you can do what you like,\\n\\nbut these creatures have\\nnow killed several people,\\n\\nand I think the smartest thing we can do\\n\\nis evacuate the town,\\nthen call in the government.\\n\\nLet them take care of it.\\n\\n- It's tough.\\n\\nBelieve me, folks.\\n\\nIt's tough.\\n\\nMr. Zachary, I'll give you a couple days.\\n\\nIf you can kill these creatures, fine.\\n\\nIf you can't, we'll have to\\ntake the sheriff's advice.\\n\\n- Very well, mayor.\\n\\nI'll get started right now.\\n\\n- Jack, I want you to give\\nMr. Zachary all the help you can.\\n\\n- Thank you, mayor,\\n\\nbut I would prefer to work alone on this.\\n\\nThat's the way I function best.\\n\\n- Oh, whatever you think, Mr. Zachary.\\n\\nThe sheriff will probably be better off\\n\\nwatching the home front anyway.\\n\\nWell, Jack.\\n\\nKeep on the alert for anyone calling in.\\n\\nIf you need me, I'll be down at Luke's.\\n\\n- I'm going on patrol.\\n\\nI'll see ya later.\\n\\n- Poor Jack.\\n\\nI think the mayor's\\nmaking a terrible mistake.\\n\\n- Yeah, I know.\\n\\nI'm so sick of looking at dead bodies,\\n\\nI'm ready to leave town now.\\n\\n- And like you said Edie,\\n\\nbullets don't have any effect on 'em.\\n\\nI wonder how Zachary's\\ngonna kill the creatures.\\n\\n- What other ways are there?\\n\\n- I don't know.\\n\\nBombs, gas?\\n\\n- Fire, maybe he could burn 'em?\\n\\n- Hm, fire, huh?\\n\\nWell, I better get back to my office.\\n\\nI'll see you two later.\\n\\n(Dramatic electronic music)\\n\\n(Edie screams)\\n\\n- Edie, Edie, calm down!\\n\\nIt's me, Steven.\\n\\n- You almost scared me to death!\\n\\n- Well, I'm sorry, but what\\nare you doing out here anyway?\\n\\n- I don't know.\\n\\nPete said the fire\\nwould kill the creatures,\\n\\nso I brought some gas.\\n\\nWell, I guess it was a stupid idea,\\n\\nbut I just don't trust that Zachary.\\n\\nThere's something\\nabout him I just don't like.\\n\\n- Yeah, he's an oddball, all right.\\n\\nHey you know that gasoline idea of yours\\n\\nmight not be too bad.\\n\\nYou bring any matches?\\n\\n- Yeah, I got mine here.\\n\\nHey you haven't told me\\nwhat you're doing out here.\\n\\n- Same thing as you, I guess.\\n\\nI just can't sit still\\n\\nknowing those creatures\\nare running around loose.\\n\\n(Suspenseful electronic music)\\n\\n(Edie screams)\\n\\n(Electronic warbling)\\n\\n(Electronic beeping)\\n\\n(Triumphant electronic music)\\n\\n- [Edie] Zachary.\\n\\n- Yes, me.\\n\\nYou realise, of course, that\\nyou almost ruined my chances\\n\\nof getting at this creature, don't you?\\n\\nDon't you?\\n\\n- Then you killed it.\\n\\nHow?\\n\\n- It was simple enough to figure out.\\n\\nThis is a hard-shelled insect form.\\n\\nSince bullets didn't penetrate it,\\n\\nI knew a different approach was needed.\\n\\nI've got a high-frequency\\nspeaker over there.\\n\\nIn effect,\\n\\nwhat I did was use an\\nextremely high-pitched sound\\n\\nto burst its shell.\\n\\n- What's that needle for?\\n\\n- I've extracted some fluid from the joint\\n\\nof this thing's claw.\\n\\nI'm sure it'll be the same poison\\n\\nfound in several of the victims.\\n\\n- Good thing you were here, Zachary.\\n\\n- Well let me tell you something.\\n\\nI don't appreciate you two coming out here.\\n\\nI almost had this thing\\ncoaxed into the sound field\\n\\nwhen you two showed\\nup and almost distracted it.\\n\\nFortunately, you lured\\nit back into my range.\\n\\nLook, I specifically said\\nI wanted to work alone.\\n\\nPerhaps now you can see my reasoning.\\n\\n- Look Mr. Zachary,\\ndespite what the mayor says,\\n\\nI have a right as a\\nreporter to be out here, too.\\n\\n- Rights don't matter in a\\nsituation like this, miss Martin.\\n\\nNow look, you either let me\\nhandle this in my own way,\\n\\nor you go call in your army.\\n\\nBut I think I have\\nproven right here and now\\n\\nthat I'm capable of dealing\\nwith these creatures.\\n\\n- All right, Mr. Zachary,\\nwe'll play the game your way.\\n\\nI apologise for the intrusion.\\n\\n(Dramatic electronic music)\\n\\n- I know you don't care for him, Jack,\\n\\nbut he did save Steven\\nand Edie's life last night.\\n\\n- So he's killed one creature.\\n\\nLook, he said there were three altogether.\\n\\nAnd we haven't seen\\nanything of the other two.\\n\\nLook, they could be miles\\nfrom this area by now.\\n\\n- I don't know.\\n\\nZachary thinks they'll stay around here\\n\\nsince this is where the\\nspaceship crashed and all.\\n\\nAnyway, look.\\n\\nI've got a crucial meeting with Mr. Farino\\n\\nabout the entertainment complex.\\n\\nI'll be back in, say, an hour.\\n\\nCall me then, and we'll discuss it further.\\n\\n- Eh, right, okay.\\n\\nAll right, goodbye, Burt.\\n\\nLook, Pete.\\n\\nI'm gonna go down to the\\nstreet and get some breakfast.\\n\\nI'm starved.\\n\\n- Okay, take your time, sheriff.\\n\\nI'll mind the store.\\n\\n- Hi, Pete.\\n\\n- Ah, Mary Jane, how are you?\\n\\n- I'm a lot better now, thanks.\\n\\n- It's good to see you up and around.\\n\\nI know you've been through a lot.\\n\\nYeah, I heard Susan went through it, too.\\n\\nAnd it was probably worse\\nthan what happened to me.\\n\\n- Yeah, you were both lucky to get away.\\n\\n- I know, I talked to Mr. Zachary,\\n\\nand he thinks that our screaming\\n\\nmay have helped keep the creature away.\\n\\n- Mm-hm, he killed them\\nwith a high-pitched sound,\\n\\nand I guess a scream\\nis pretty close to that.\\n\\n- I don't even like to think about it.\\n\\nIt's like a nightmare, and\\nI'm just so glad it's over.\\n\\n- Well, I'll be glad when it's all over.\\n\\n- I know.\\n\\nWell, I was on my way\\nto mayor wicker's house\\n\\nto thank him for helping,\\n\\nand I just wanted to stop by and say hi.\\n\\n- Well, I'm glad you did.\\n\\nNow you take care of yourself, okay?\\n\\n- I will.\\n\\nI'll see you later, Pete.\\n\\n- Okay.\\n\\n(Objects clatter)\\n\\n(Dramatic electronic warbling)\\n\\n(Objects clatter)\\n\\n(Suspenseful electronic music)\\n\\n- Ah!\\n\\n(Burt screams)\\n\\n(Creature groans)\\n\\n- Pete, you there?\\n\\n- Yes, sheriff, where are you?\\n\\n- I'm at stemmer's creek road.\\n\\nLook, I was thinkin' it over,\\n\\nand I'm convinced this thing\\n\\nshould be in the hands of the government,\\n\\nso I'm gonna run by the mayor's house\\n\\nand try to talk some sense into him.\\n\\n- Oh boy, he isn't going to like that.\\n\\n- Well, I don't care if he does or not.\\n\\nAnyway, Ruth's gonna stop by\\n\\nwith the report on the Bradford killing.\\n\\nSo you take care of\\nthings for me, will you?\\n\\n- Okay, sheriff.\\n\\n(Uptempo electronic music)\\n\\n- Mary Jane!\\n\\nMary Jane, what's wrong?\\n\\n- I should've, nothing,\\nmaybe I can't get it!\\n\\nThey mayor's dead, he's killed the mayor!\\n\\n(Mary Jane screams)\\n\\n(Creature groans)\\n\\n(Engine revs)\\n\\n(Engine revs)\\n\\nSheriff, it's coming!\\n\\n(Engine revs)\\n\\n- [Jack] Pete, Pete!\\n\\nAnswer quickly!\\n\\n- What's wrong, sheriff?\\n\\n- I need help!\\n\\nGet out to the mayor's place fast!\\n\\n- Oh my god, the sheriff's in trouble!\\n\\nGet my car, quickly Steven!\\n\\n- Well, don't you think\\n\\nwe should let Pete take\\ncare of this aunt Ruth?\\n\\n- Will you hurry?\\n\\n(Creature groans)\\n\\n(Mary Jane screams)\\n\\n- Come on, Mary Jane, come on!\\n\\n(Creature groans)\\n\\n(Mary Jane screams)\\n\\nMary Jane, lock the door behind me.\\n\\n(Suspenseful electronic music)\\n\\n(Gun fires)\\n\\n(Creature groans)\\n\\n(Gun fires)\\n\\n(Horn honks)\\n\\n(Gun fires)\\n\\n(Creature groans)\\n\\n(Dart zings)\\n\\n(Suspenseful

planned it that way.\\n\\n- I came here to talk to the mayor.\\n\\n- And by the way, where is the mayor?\\n\\n- He's dead, behind the garage.\\n\\n- Well, this thing\\nwon't kill anything else,\\n\\nthat's for sure.\\n\\n- Yes, speaking of that,\\nwhat did you use to kill it?\\n\\n- It's a specially-designed\\nweapon I devised myself.\\n\\nIt fires a projectile placed at the tip,\\n\\nin this case, a hypodermic needle,\\n\\nwhich injects fluid upon\\nimpact with the target.\\n\\nActually, that giant\\ninsect I killed last night\\n\\nhelped kill this creature.\\n\\n- What do you mean?\\n\\n- Remember that poison I extracted?\\n\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n- Well, that's the same\\npoison I shot into this creature.\\n\\nWhen the doctor said how lethal the poison\\n\\nfound in the victims was,\\n\\nI reasoned that it might be lethal enough\\n\\nto kill one of these other creatures.\\n\\nIt was a gamble, but it paid off.\\n\\n(Dramatic electronic music)\\n\\n- [Pete] Thinkin' about the mayor, sheriff?\\n\\n- Well, I guess a little bit.\\n\\nThat and everything else that's happened.\\n\\nIt's been like a crazy nightmare.\\n\\n(Phone rings)\\n\\nPete, will you get that for me?\\n\\nI don't really feel like talkin'.\\n\\n- Sheriff's office.\\n\\nUh, just a minute.\\n\\nDid you put in a call to a Mr. Dodds\\n\\nat the Garrett observatory?\\n\\n- Yeah, my call about Zachary.\\n\\nHello, Mr. Dodds.\\n\\nSheriff cinder, yes.\\n\\nYes, sir.\\n\\nYes, I talked to your secretary yesterday.\\n\\nUh-huh.\\n\\nBenjamin Zachary.\\n\\nOh, I see.\\n\\nWell, no, we'll handle it.\\n\\nLook, thank you very much, Mr. Dodds.\\n\\nOkay, goodbye.\\n\\nMy hunch was right.\\n\\nThey never heard of a Mr. Zachary\\n\\nat the Garrett observatory.\\n\\n(Suspenseful electronic music)\\n\\n(Creature roars)\\n\\n(Creature roars)\\n\\n(Creature roars)\\n\\n(Creature roars)\\n\\n(Creature roars)\\n\\n(Sombre electronic music)\\n\\n- Mr. Zachary, are you all right?\\n\\n- You certainly are\\npersistent, miss Martin.\\n\\n- That thing you were\\nfighting, where'd it go?\\n\\nIs it dead?\\n\\n- It's quite dead.\\n\\nYour town is safe again now.\\n\\n- What kind of ungodly being was that?\\n\\n- It's called a leemoid, miss Martin.\\n\\nAnd it's a devilish creature\\n\\ncapable of withdrawing the very life force\\n\\nout of other beings.\\n\\nThe same creature\\nresponsible for that aged corpse\\n\\nthat none of you could figure out.\\n\\n- I'm getting confused.\\n\\nIf it can take the life out of others,\\n\\nwhy couldn't it kill you?\\n\\n- Oh, I have my own protective\\nforce against the leemoid,\\n\\nalthough it did weaken me.\\n\\n- I don't understand.\\n\\nYou keep referring to it\\nas though you know it.\\n\\n- No, stop, that's close enough.\\n\\n- Why, what's wrong?\\n\\nI'm surprised you haven't figured it out.\\n\\n- What, what do you mean?\\n\\n- Edie.\\n\\nDon't you see?\\n\\nI am an alien, too.\\n\\nThese three creatures that I've killed,\\n\\nthey're wild beasts brought to earth\\n\\nquite by accident.\\n\\nI knew the space craft\\nhad crashed in those hills.\\n\\nI used the meteor story as a cover.\\n\\n- Wait, wait, this doesn't make any sense.\\n\\n- If you'll just listen a moment.\\n\\nThat space craft was en route to my planet.\\n\\nThe cargo, of course,\\nwere the three creatures\\n\\nwho've been terrorising your town.\\n\\nThey were zoological specimens\\ncaptured on distant worlds\\n\\nand being brought back\\nto my world for study.\\n\\nThat alien I communicated with\\n\\nwas another intelligent\\nbeing from my planet.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the craft\\nmalfunctioned and crashed here.\\n\\nI was sent to intercede\\n\\nwith as little spectacle as possible.\\n\\n- I still don't understand.\\n\\nYou're human like us and you speak English.\\n\\n- Humanoid, Edie, but not like your people.\\n\\nOur technology is extremely advanced.\\n\\nI was able to manufacture a disguise,\\n\\nand I learned your\\nlanguage through telepathy.\\n\\nI acted cold and distant\\n\\nbecause I knew the\\ndanger all of you were facing,\\n\\nand I wanted to keep you away from it.\\n\\nIt was the only way I knew how.\\n\\n- Why are you hiding\\nback there in the shadows?\\n\\n- The leemoid destroyed\\nmy earthly disguise,\\n\\nand although we are a peaceable race,\\n\\nto you, I would look horrible.\\n\\n- I wanna see what you look like.\\n\\n- No, please!\\n\\n(Suspenseful electronic music)\\n\\n(Edie sobs and screams)\\n\\nEdie, look out!\\n\\n- No, Jack, no!\\n\\n(Gun fires)\\n\\nIt was Zachary, Jack, it was Zachary.\\n\\nHe wasn't gonna hurt me.
